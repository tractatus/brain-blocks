Standardize your anatomical work for using Allen Brain Reference atlas.

A coronal brain block printed in frosted detail plastic. Freshly perfused brains can be directly inserted into the mold and wrapped together with rubberbands and placed in fixation medium (e.g. PFA) into a falcon tube over night.

Coronal sections can be generated with a 1 mm spacing using a blade no thicker than standard .009'' double edged razor.
Approximate bregma is marked with a small circle on both sides of the brain block.
